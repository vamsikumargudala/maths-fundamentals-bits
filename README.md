# Zero Level Mathematical Foundation - M.Tech AI/ML

## Overview
This repository contains all study materials, notes, and practice problems for the Zero Level Mathematical Foundation course, a prerequisite for the Mathematics for Machine Learning module in the M.Tech AI/ML program.


## Structure

- **Source/**: Contains all official course materials:
	- `Lecture0a.pdf` (Matrix Fundamentals)
	- `Lecture0b.pdf` (Linear Systems)
	- `Lecture 0c.pdf` (Determinants & Eigenvalues)
	- `Practice_Problems_I_Zero_Level_Mathematical_Foundation.pdf`
	- `Practice_Problems_II_Zero_Level_Mathematical_Foundation.pdf`

## How to Use

1. **Start with the Executive Summary** to understand the course requirements and deadlines.
2. **Study each lecture briefing** (0a, 0b, 0c) in order, using the practice problems guide for self-assessment.
3. **Use the Octave code snippets** in each document to verify calculations and build intuition.
4. **Work through the practice problem PDFs** in the Source folder, referencing the guide for solution strategies.
5. **Review session notes** for additional explanations and analogies from the professor.
