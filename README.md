## Notes: Quick Navigation

- [Executive Summary & Preparation Guide](My%20Notes/00%20-%20Executive%20Summary%20and%20Preparation%20Guide.md):
  - Synthesis of all bridge sessions and lecture content. Outlines the three pillars to master and key deadlines.
- [Lecture 0a: Matrix Fundamentals Briefing](My%20Notes/Lecture%201%20-%20Matrix%20Fundamentals%20Briefing.md):
  - Matrix definitions, operations, special types, and row operations. Key for all AI/ML data representation.
- [Lecture 0b: Linear Systems Briefing](My%20Notes/Lecture%202%20-%20Linear%20Systems%20Briefing.md):
  - Linear systems, row echelon forms, rank, and solution types. Consistency rules and solution strategies.
- [Lecture 0c: Determinants and Eigenvalues Briefing](My%20Notes/Lecture%203%20-%20Determinants%20and%20Eigenvalues%20Briefing.md):
  - Determinants, invertibility, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Foundation for advanced ML topics.
- [Practice Problems Guide](My%20Notes/Practice%20Problems%20Guide.md):
  - Step-by-step strategies and templates for all problem types. Use with official practice problem sets.

## Structure

- **Source/**: Contains all official course materials:
	- `Lecture0a.pdf` (Matrix Fundamentals)
	- `Lecture0b.pdf` (Linear Systems)
	- `Lecture 0c.pdf` (Determinants & Eigenvalues)
	- `Practice_Problems_I_Zero_Level_Mathematical_Foundation.pdf`
	- `Practice_Problems_II_Zero_Level_Mathematical_Foundation.pdf`

## How to Use

1. **Start with the Executive Summary** to understand the course requirements and deadlines.
2. **Study each lecture briefing** (0a, 0b, 0c) in order, using the practice problems guide for self-assessment.
3. **Use the Octave code snippets** in each document to verify calculations and build intuition.
4. **Work through the practice problem PDFs** in the Source folder, referencing the guide for solution strategies.
5. **Review session notes** for additional explanations and analogies from the professor.
